### Credits
Thanks to Ania Kubow and FreeCodeCamp for the tutorial, which you can find on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAUn1Lom6dw&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).

### Purpose
After graduating, I wanted a refresher in vanilla JavaScript. I decided to follow this tutorial on how to build a classic game of Tetris. As a challenge, I want to change some styling to hone my CSS skills and get around to implementing levels of difficulty.

### How to Play
Begin by cloning this repo to your local machine, and CD into it. In your Terminal or IDE, type 'open index.html'. This will prompt your computer to open a new local file. You can start playing!

### Languages
This was built entirely on HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
